# Welcome to TaskSheet!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Development server
For a version of the app you can utilize the mock API to retrieve sample data in

- Run `npm i` to install all the 3rd party packages
- Run `npm run api` to host the mock API (on `http://localhost:3000`)
- Run `npm run start` for a dev server to open @ `http://localhost:4200/`

## Production Build
Recommended as a well optimized and lighter weight version of the app to really showcase its beauty âœ¨

Run `npm run build` to build the project. (The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.) To properly host the build output, it is recommended that you use `http-server`:
- Install this tool globally: `npm install http-server -g`
- Then run `http-server dist/task-sheet` for a locally hosted version @ `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
